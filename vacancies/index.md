# Postdoc

We invite applications for a two-year research position at the postdoctoral level.  
This position is part of the EC-funded project Global Under-Resourced Media Translation ([Gourmet](https://gourmet-project.eu)) whose overall aim is to develop data-efficient neural machine translation for under-resourced languages. 
The successful applicant will work under the supervision of [Wilker Aziz](https://wilkeraziz.github.io) and in collaboration with other members of the project.

The main tasks include developing NMT systems for under-resourced languages (e.g. Turkish, Gujarati, Swahili), exploring and adapting existing models for this low-resource scenario, learning from little or incomplete supervision, making use of linguistic prior knowledge (e.g. via changes to the model and/or data augmentation).

We are based in Amsterdam, a welcoming and international European capital, where English speakers will find no language barrier. 

Questions about the role can be emailed to [Wilker Aziz](mailto:w.aziz@uva.nl), 
applications should be submitted online before 3 May 2019 using the link in the [vacancy text](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/uva/en/vacancies/2019/03/19-171-postdoctoral-researcher-in-neural-machine-translation.html).

* Job title: Postdoctoral researcher in neural machine translation
* Requirements: PhD in a topic related to machine translation or closely-related topics in natural language processing.
* Deadline: 3 May 2019, see [vacancy text](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/uva/en/vacancies/2019/03/19-171-postdoctoral-researcher-in-neural-machine-translation.html)
