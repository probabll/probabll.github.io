This group is taking a short break to take a short course on information theory. We will resume our activities soon after that.

## Textbook 

The main textbook we discuss is [Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd edition)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/). We meet roughly every Friday at 3pm (check the calendar).
You're welcome to join us, but note that we've already discussed all of Part I.
