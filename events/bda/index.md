This group is interested in *statistical data analysis* (i.e., analysis of outcomes of random experiments) and for that we need to talk about **Bayes**. Yes, that's right, we said it and you can quote us, *it isn't right if it isn't Bayesian*. If you agree, you should probably join us. If you disagree, you *must* join us :-)


## Resources

The main textbook for this group is [Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd edition)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/), which the publisher has made freely available. We meet roughly every Friday at 3pm (check the calendar). You're obviously welcome to join us, but note that we've already discussed all of Part I. 

We are currently taking a short break to discuss some research papers (see agenda below) as well as to take a short course on information theory, but we will resume our activities soon after that.
